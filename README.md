# Image-Resizer

... 4 years later this code makes me cringe... but it works. Maybe I'll come back and refactor some of it. But maybe not.

Quick application written in C# to resize, compress, and convert images.

Compress requires TinyPNG api key. This is available free for under 500 images per month. Place key in app.config.

Convert only converts to PNG. Does not work with animated GIFs.

Some features maybe coming soon, but maybe not.
